## The Project (I had to use a dictionary to know how to spell this)

  

A project completed for Aloha Apparel Co. as a part of the Web Development program at RED academy. Following guidelines the page has been designed to be responsive

with the following breakpoints

2.Tablet (720px) 

3.Desktop (1240p)

  
  
### Built with (everyone else's help)

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

jQuery

  
  
  

### Personal Learnings (My biggest achievemet is that I now have one friend)

Personal learnings include, HTML CSS and an introduction into javaScript and Jquery with these come the importance of a knowledge of structure, syntax,debugging and how to lay out a responsive design.
